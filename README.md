Superstore Price Prediction

📌 Project Overview

The Superstore Price Prediction project aims to predict the profit or loss of a superstore based on various business factors such as product category, discount, sales trends, and regional data. This project utilizes Machine Learning techniques to build a predictive model that helps in decision-making for optimizing business performance.

🚀 Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering and selection

Implementation of various ML algorithms

Model evaluation and performance comparison

Deployment of the model using Flask

📂 Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes:

Product Name – Name of the product

Category – Product category (e.g., Electronics, Furniture, Office Supplies)

Sub-Category – More specific classification of the product

Region – Location of the store

Discount – Discount applied to the product

Sales – Sales amount

Profit/Loss – Profitability of the sale

🔧 Technologies Used

Python – Primary programming language

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

Scikit-learn – ML algorithms and model building

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Flask – Web framework for deployment

📊 Machine Learning Approach

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding.

Feature Engineering: Selecting the most impactful features using feature selection methods.

Model Selection: Implementing algorithms like:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

XGBoost

Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² Score to assess performance.
