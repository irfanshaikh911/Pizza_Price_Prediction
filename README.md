# Superstore Price Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview  
The **Superstore Price Prediction** project aims to predict the **profit or loss** of a superstore based on various business factors such as **product category, discount, sales trends, and regional data**. This project utilizes **Machine Learning** techniques to build a predictive model that helps in **decision-making for optimizing business performance**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **Data preprocessing and cleaning**  
- **Feature engineering and selection**  
- **Implementation of various ML algorithms**  
- **Model evaluation and performance comparison**  
- **Deployment of the model using Flask**  

## 📂 Dataset  
The dataset used for this project includes:  
- **Product Name** – Name of the product  
- **Category** – Product category (e.g., Electronics, Furniture, Office Supplies)  
- **Sub-Category** – More specific classification of the product  
- **Region** – Location of the store  
- **Discount** – Discount applied to the product  
- **Sales** – Sales amount  
- **Profit/Loss** – Profitability of the sale  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- **Python** – Primary programming language  
- **Pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and analysis  
- **Scikit-learn** – ML algorithms and model building  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **Flask** – Web framework for deployment  

## 📊 Machine Learning Approach  
### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Handling **missing values, outliers, and categorical encoding**.  

### 2. Feature Engineering  
- Selecting the most impactful features using **feature selection methods**.  

### 3. Model Selection  
- Implementing algorithms like:  
  - **Linear Regression**  
  - **Decision Tree**  
  - **Random Forest**  
  - **XGBoost**  

### 4. Evaluation  
- Using metrics like:  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
  - **R² Score**
